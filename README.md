# ðŸ”¥Moving Heat Flux Simulation in Abaqus using Fortran (DFLUX)

A high-fidelity thermal simulation in **Abaqus** using a custom **DFLUX subroutine (Fortran)** to model a **moving Gaussian heat source**.  
This project demonstrates how advanced FEA techniques can capture **laser/welding-like heat transfer** and predict **temperature evolution (NT11)** in real time.

##  Whatâ€™s Inside
- Moving_HF.inp â†’ Abaqus input file (geometry, mesh, material, BCs).  
- dflux4.f â†’ Fortran DFâ€‹LUX subroutine for moving Gaussian flux.  
- NT11Temp_MovingHF.gif â†’ Animated results of temperature distribution.  
 
##  Why It Matters
- Simulates **real-world processes**: laser heating, welding, additive manufacturing.  
- Shows **integration of FEA + custom programming** for advanced simulations.  
- Demonstrates **thermal-material interaction** under localized moving loads.  

##  Skills Showcased
- Abaqus (FEA for heat transfer)  
- User subroutines in Fortran (DFLUX)  
- Simulation of moving thermal sources  
- Result visualization (contours & animations)  
- Technical documentation (GitHub project)
